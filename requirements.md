## ðŸ”¹ 1. Stakeholder Requirements

| ID     | Requirement Description |
|--------|--------------------------|
| SR-01  | The system shall demonstrate the application of AI techniques, particularly Q-learning, in a grid-based environment. |
| SR-02  | The system shall provide a visual or textual output showing how the agent navigates to the goal while avoiding obstacles. |
| SR-03  | The simulation shall serve as a learning tool for understanding reinforcement learning concepts. |
| SR-04  | The project shall be usable in both academic and demonstrational contexts, suitable for students or beginner AI developers. |
| SR-05  | The project shall offer modular and readable code for extension (e.g., upgrading to deep reinforcement learning). |

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Product/System Requirements

| ID     | Requirement Description |
|--------|--------------------------|
| PR-01  | The system shall simulate a grid environment with defined start, goal, and obstacle positions. |
| PR-02  | The AI agent shall use Q-learning to learn an optimal path through the grid. |
| PR-03  | The agent shall update its Q-table based on states, actions, and rewards throughout multiple episodes. |
| PR-04  | The simulation shall display or log the agentâ€™s progress across training iterations. |
| PR-05  | The system shall allow environment customization (grid size, reward values, obstacle layout). |
| PR-06  | The final output shall demonstrate the agent reaching the goal using the learned optimal policy. |
| PR-07  | The system shall produce a working prototype that visually or textually confirms goal achievement. |
| PR-08  | Optional: The system may animate the agentâ€™s path using libraries such as `matplotlib` or `pygame`. |
